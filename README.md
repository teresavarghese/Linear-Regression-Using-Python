# Linear-Regression-Using-Python

This repository contains two Jupyter Notebook files implementing linear regression using both traditional machine learning techniques and deep learning with Keras.

# Linear Regression using Machine Learning (ML)

**File:** linear_regression_using_ml.ipynb

## Description:

Implements linear regression using various machine learning techniques such as LinearRegression from scikit-learn and RandomForestRegressor. Demonstrates the process of data preprocessing, model training, testing, and evaluation. Includes examples of splitting the data into training and testing sets, and calculating accuracy.

# Linear Regression using Deep Learning (DL)

**File:** linear_regression_using_dl.ipynb

## Description:

Implements linear regression using deep learning techniques with Keras. Constructs a neural network model with multiple dense layers. Demonstrates the process of defining the model architecture, compiling the model, training the model, and making predictions. Includes examples of training and testing the model, as well as evaluating performance metrics such as mean squared error.
